# translink-trains [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/HundredPercentCoverage/translink-trains.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/HundredPercentCoverage/translink-trains)

This project was built with [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) and [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

Aim - create a simple app to read real-time passenger rail information from Translink. Serves as an exercise in consuming public APIs and proxying requests.

### Proxying
There is an issue with this app whereby accessing the information from the Translink APIs directly results in a CORS error. To get around this, a proxy needs to be used. The app can either use the [cors.io](http://cors.io/) proxy, which is useful for running the app on GitHub pages (but unreliable if the proxy goes down), a custom quick-and-dirty proxy I have hosted on Heroku, or via a [local proxy](https://github.com/AnalogueMachine/translink-proxy) which of course only works if running the app locally.

## To run locally:
Step 1:
- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install` within root directory
- Run `npm run start` to run the app frontend

Step 2 (do this in a separate terminal):
- Clone the [proxy repo](https://github.com/AnalogueMachine/translink-proxy)
- Run `npm install` within the proxy directory
- Run `npm run offline` in the proxy directory - note that this script is configured for Windows and may need modified on your machine.

Step 3 (until I figure out env vars):
- In the `stationServices.js` file, ensure the appropriate calls are uncommented from the two calls to the proxy / API. There are currently three:
  - Calls to [cors.io](https://cors.io/) which was useful during development but prone to breaking. Note that these calls includes logic to extract the data.
  - Calls to `/stations` and `/station/{code}`, which assume that the proxy is running.
  - Calls to the proxy on **Heroku**. Please don't break it.
